      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>The University of Michigan (UM) is a reputable, well-rounded public university with over 50,000 students and
        faculty members.
        One day, when I was having difficulties figuring out how to solve my website coding issues,
        I thought,
        <br><br>‘Since we have so many intelligent students from such a wide range of disciplines, <span class="bold">what
          if I could
          have a peer tutor providing me support and feedback in learning subjects I want to learn?’</span>,
        and then <span class="bold">‘What if UM
          students
          could have peer-tutoring platform based on their learning needs and everyone can be both a tutor and tutee?’</span>

        <br><br>I decided to take this challenge for my individual project in class <span class="italic">SI 582:
          Introduction to Interaction Design</span>, taught
        by <a class="linkedin" target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonyamccarley/">Professor McCarley</a>.
        In fact, I realized that many
        UM students had been raising similar questions when <span class="bold">they were unable to get help from school
          resources or could not find a right person to tutor them on their problems together.</span> 
      </p>

      <section class="overview">
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>
      
          <span class="bold">Earn & Learn</span> is an application
          that connects UM students
          based on
          individual needs for learning. Learning subjects can be anything from courseworks to technical skills, and
          <span class="bold">students
            can be a tutor or tutee.</span>
      
          <br><br> <span class="italic">Why this solution?</span>
      
      
          <br><br><span class="bold">1) Effectiveness of peer tutoring</span>
          <br>According to various <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nea.org/tools/35542.htm/" class="underline italic">research</a>,
          peer tutoring has its great benefits in higher learning achievement, improved relationships with peers, improved
          personal and social development as well as increased motivation.
          <br><br> <span class="bold">2) Great advantages of in-person tutoring</span>
          <br><a target="_blank" href="https://hechingerreport.org/cheaper-human-tutors-can-be-highly-effective-studies-show/"
            class="underline italic">Many studies</a> show that in-person, one-on-one tutoring is one of the most powerful
          way of learning compared to other options. My research also shows that the majority of students found in-person
          tutoring is more helpful than other options such as online education.
      
          <br><br> <span class="bold">3) Fostering equality in access to in-person/private tutoring.</span>
          <br>Regardless of its effectiveness, private tutoring has been too expensive for students. Through the solution,
          students can explore more affordable options of in-person learning opportunity.
      
          <br><br> <span class="bold">4) Providing meaningful economic activity/business opportunities for students</span>
          <br>Tutors on the platform (anyone) can be a tutor to share their knowledge, make some money, as well as build
          their own brand and business. This would open small and big business opportunities for students without heavy
          upfront investment. When the solution prospers, this platform can be used to connect between students and employers
          based on each party's needs.

      <h2>Framing the problem</h2>
      <p>
        In this stage, I conducted <span class="bold">user research</span> and <span class="bold">competitive analysis</span>
        to frame the problem.
        <br><br>For user research, I utilized methods of <span class="bold">survey </span> and <span class="bold">user
          interviews</span>.
        <br><br>For competitive analysis, I took a critical look at existing solutions within my context and analyzed
        <span class="bold">their pros and cons</span> in respect to supporting my target activity.
        I particularly selected four key players in the industry, and conducted competitive assessment.
        I was thereby able to compile a <span class="bold">list of problems or frustrating aspects of the current

          through sketch.</span> In class, we had
        training about rapid brainstorming with structure with the group. We choose two axes for our design matrix and
        brainstormed based on the given instructions. This helped me a lot in expanding my ideas and developing
        creativity.

        <br><br>After the brainstorming session, I completed ideation through sketch: I sketched eight possible
        solutions to my design
        problems, which allowed me to think in different contexts where my system could be used to inspire new,
        creative ideas.

        <br><br>After, I sketched <span class="bold">user storyboard</span> to help convey our design problem and
        solution. By doing so, I was better able to
        sympathize with my hypothetical user, and reconsider whether my solution will truly solve the user's problem.

          This is because 1) my target users, mostly students, enjoy mobile application service,
          and 2) it is the most feasible solution in the near future.

          <br><br>I created three <span class="bold">personas</span> and one <span class="bold">anti-persona</span> to
          better understand needs and goals of my users.
          After, I picked my two primary personas and condcuted <span class="bold">story mapping</span> for a better

          <br><br>By using all previous efforts, I solidify
          <span class="bold">user flow chart</span> and draw <span class="bold">wireframes</span>. With lo-fidelity wireframes, I conducted user testings and received precious feedback for design iteration.

        <h2>User Flow Chart & Wireframes</h2>
        <p>
            After, I was able to solidify user flows by creating user flow chart, and this led me to draw wireframes. When drawing wireframes, I came back to competitive analysis and looked at similar products to better understand their UX/UI design, so I could consider more about the overall experience of my design ideas.

      I tested this prototype by assigning users various tasks to complete. When the users got stuck, I
      asked them to write them down immediately so I could better understand where the breakdowns were occurring.

          <h2>Why this solution?</h2>
          <p>
            
           <span class="bold">1) Effectiveness of peer tutoring</span>
            <br>According to various <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nea.org/tools/35542.htm/" class="underline italic">research</a>,
            peer tutoring has its great benefits in higher learning achievement, improved relationships with peers, improved
            personal and social development as well as increased motivation.
            <br><br> <span class="bold">2) Great advantages of in-person tutoring</span>
            <br><a target="_blank" href="https://hechingerreport.org/cheaper-human-tutors-can-be-highly-effective-studies-show/"
              class="underline italic">Many studies</a> show that in-person, one-on-one tutoring is one of the most powerful
            way of learning compared to other options. My research also shows that the majority of students found in-person
            tutoring is more helpful than other options such as online education.
        
            <br><br> <span class="bold">3) Fostering equality in access to in-person/private tutoring.</span>
            <br>Regardless of its effectiveness, private tutoring has been too expensive for students. Through the solution,
            students can explore more affordable options of in-person learning opportunity.
        
            <br><br> <span class="bold">4) Providing meaningful economic activity/business opportunities for students</span>
            <br>Tutors on the platform (anyone) can be a tutor to share their knowledge, make some money, as well as build
            their own brand and business. This would open small and big business opportunities for students without heavy
            upfront investment. When the solution prospers, this platform can be used to connect between students and employers
            based on each party's needs.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          This project gave me two important takeaways.<br><br>
          <span class="bold">One: Design iteration based on feedbacks brings powerful results.</span>
          <br><br>I iterated design more than 20 times including all small interactions and adding/subtracting contents. I tried not to miss one single feedback. I took it seriously and deeply thought about how I could translate it into my design. 
          By iterating design processes, I can see that my solution is becoming more solid and importantly, becoming user-centered. It also helped me to deeply empathize with my users. I've learned that be open to feedbacks and analyze it critically brings much more powerful outcomes than I expected.
          
          <br><br> <span class="bold">Two: Designing for accessibility and social impact.</span>
          <br><br>As having more and more interactions among users, I was able to further consider what and how my solution can bring positive social impact to the community for everyone regardless of their ability, context, or situation.

          I thought about appropriate color contrast of my whole design, adding more indicator such as text labels or patterns when showing success/error message, having clear focus indicators, etc. Through the process, I deeply felt responsible for designing for everyone, realizing importance of inclusive design.
